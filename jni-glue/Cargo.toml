[features]
default = []

# You should use this feature *only* if you need to define JNI_OnLoad / JNI_OnUnload yourself, for example because
# you're using multiple conflicting versions of jni-glue.  In this case, you are responsible for manually defining
# JNI_OnLoad / JNI_OnUnload, and calling jni_glue::on_load / jni_glue::on_unload yourself.  Failure to do so may
# introduce soundness issues due to using dangling VM instances!
