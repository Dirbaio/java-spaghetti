# ‚òïÔ∏èüçù `java-spaghetti`

Generate type-safe bindings for calling Java APIs from Rust, so you can fearlessly make your humongous Java spaghetti code aglomeration trascend language barriers and occupy an even larger fraction of the universe's space-time.

## Differences vs `jni-bindgen`

This project originally started out as a fork of [`jni-bindgen`](https://github.com/MaulingMonkey/jni-bindgen).

The main difference is the intended usage: `jni-bindgen` aims to generate crates with bindings for a whole Java API (such as `jni-android-sys`) which
you then use from your crate. `java-spaghetti` is instead designed to generate "mini-bindings" tailored to your project, that you can embed within your crate. This has a few advantages:

- You can generate a single bindings file for e.g. part of the Android API and your project's classes at the same time, which is better because you end up with only one copy of shared classes like `java.lang.String`.
- Java APIs can get big. `jni-android-sys` uses one Cargo feature per class to avoid compile time bloat, which is [no longer allowed on crates.io](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2023/10/26/broken-badges-and-23k-keywords.html).

The full list of differences are:

- Simplified and more consistent API.
- You can filter which classes are generated in the TOML config.
- Generated code uses relative paths (`super::...`) instead of absolute paths (`crate::...`), so it works if you place it in a submodule not at the crate root.
- Generated code is a single `.rs` file, there's no support for spltting it in one file per class. You can still run the output through [form](https://github.com/djmcgill/form), if you want.
- No support for generating Cargo features per class.
- Modernized rust, updated dependencies.
